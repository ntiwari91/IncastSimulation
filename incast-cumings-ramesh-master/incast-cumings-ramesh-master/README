To reproduce the results of our experiment:

1. On Amazon.s EC2, launch an instance of cs244-mininet (ami-cb8851a2), of
   type c1.medium.

2. Copy the necessary Python scripts to a directory within your home
   directory on the instance.

3. Open a shell and go to the directory containing the Python scripts copied
   in step 2.

4. Execute the following commands:

   $ sudo chown ubuntu ~/.matplotlib
   $ chmod 777 *.py

   The first command is necessary because .matplotlib is initially owned by
   root.  The second makes the Python scripts executable.

5. To run the experiment, execute the following command:

   $ sudo ./reproduceResults.py

   On the first execution, it will fail after a few seconds.  Execute the
   command again and it should run to completion.  The experiment may take a
   couple hours to complete.

6. As the script runs, it will output the goodput values it records
   periodically. When the script completes, three image files named
   figure1.png, figure2.png and figure3.png will be in the current directory.
   These correspond to Figures 1b, Figures 2b, and Figures 3 in this report.
